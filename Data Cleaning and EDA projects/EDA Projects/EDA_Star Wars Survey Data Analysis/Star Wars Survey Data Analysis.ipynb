    "#### Thus we can observe that Episode 5 and Episode 6 have the highest views. Episode 1 may have had very high views due to the hype as it was the first Star Wars sequel in close to two decades. Then as the viewers (most likely) didn't like it, the views for Episodes 2 and 3 went down further. This reinforces the view that Episodes 4-6 were considered better than Episodes 1-3, based on the rankings analysis."
